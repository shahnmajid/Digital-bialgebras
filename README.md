# Digital-bialgebras
Accompanies the paper "Digital quantum groups" by S. Majid and A. Pachol with associated data for n=4 algebras and bialgebras.
These are packages in the .zip file for the programme R which you will need. Two readme.txts from inside the zip are also uploaded so you can see what to expect.
